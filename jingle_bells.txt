COMMENTS:
My music file notation works in this way: The first number at the top of file represents length of full note in microseconds.
Position 1 in each note is note length, position 2 and 3 represent note itself, position 4 represents 'R' for sharp, 'b' for flat, 
and 'N' for neither. Last position has 'S' for staccato, 'L' for legato and 'N' for non-legato.
